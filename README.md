📚 Alice Chikezie Digital Hospital

This is a simple website, representing the official web presence of Alice Chikezie Memorial Medical Centre Foundation. The website is built with HTML and hosted on GitHub.

👥 Target Users

- Health information officers
- Nurses (if needed)

❗ Importance

The need for this website arose from the fact that managing thousands of patients' files and hundreds of case files over the years can be overwhelming. When a patient revisits the hospital, accessing their medical record can be challenging if the physical file is misplaced. This website increases the probability of tracking and tracing all patients' files, making it easier to manage and retrieve patient data.

⚙ How It Works

This digital hospital website is designed to facilitate the tracing of patients' files. It helps Health information officers (receptionists) easily track patients' data, as managing bulky physical files can be difficult. Users can upload patients' data and store the details for easy tracking. Over time, when needed, they can log in and search for a patient's name to retrieve more details about the patient.

💡 Additional Features

- Nurses and doctors can add patients' appointments and medication
- The dashboard displays:
    - Daily appointments
    - Active medications
    - Total number of patients the facility has (provided the information management officers have uploaded the patients' details)
